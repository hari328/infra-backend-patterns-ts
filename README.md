# infra-backend-patterns-ts
contains all the code to setup aws account for backend deployment

this folder will be deployed using terraform and github actions.

we are preparing a base aws infra and also observability tools like prometheus, loki, tempo, grafana.

we are deploying the services in the github repo: https://github.com/hari328/backend-patterns-ts

I have thought about how it should look the base-infra in the folder has the details needed.

I want to use terragrunt here not terraform
